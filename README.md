# Awesome Project (To Do List Mobile App)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). as part of a "Teach yourself day" at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.  

Why did I choose this subject?

+ I wanted to learn a framework for mobile development 

What problem does it solve?

+ Many people access the internet on the phones a majorifty of the time, and some poeple exclusively access the internet via phone, so being able to build mobile apps is extrememly valuable and important. 

What did I build?

+ I built a simple to-do list app

What are the alternatives?

+ There are other languages and frameworks for mobile development such as Swift, BuildFire.js

What is it similar to, if anything?

+ React Native is similar to React which we covered in class, so it was easy to jump right in.  

What is the history of this technology?

+ React Native began as an internal hackathon project for facebook.  

Who is maintaining it?

+ It is open sourced on github

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

+ I found it really easy to get going.  There are good guides/tutorials to follow.  

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

+ The hardest part was remembering that I can't use normal html or JSX notation inside of the render() function.  

What resources do you recommend for interested students?

+ [This](https://hackernoon.com/learning-react-native-where-to-start-49df64cf14a2) article and these two guides were very helpful: [1](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/), [2](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

1. What is the difference between React and React Native?

2. Does React Native use the same codebase for Android and iOS?

3. Can you use native code alongside react native?
